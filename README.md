Official implementation of the TD-QAS framework as described in our paper: "Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search Framework" (DOI: ).



Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search (TD-QAS)
Overview

This repository contains the code for the Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search (TD-QAS) framework, which enhances the efficiency and scalability of Quantum Architecture Search (QAS). The TD-QAS framework decouples the search process into two distinct phases: topology search and gate-type fine-tuning. This approach reduces the search space significantly and allows for more efficient quantum circuit design.

The framework has been implemented on two representative QAS algorithms, QuantumSupernet and DQAS, and is validated through numerical simulations on a variety of quantum tasks such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), MaxCut problem, and quantum state classification.
